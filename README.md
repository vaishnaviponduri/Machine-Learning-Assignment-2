Programming Problems

# 1)Decision Trees

Implemented decision tree classifiers (sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier) with varying depths.

Compared training and testing accuracy to identify underfitting (shallow trees) and overfitting (deep trees).

# 2)k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)

Trained kNN classifiers (sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier) with different values of k.

Visualized decision boundaries to see how k controls model complexity (low k → more flexible, high variance; high k → smoother, higher bias).

Used confusion matrix and classification report to evaluate accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Plotted ROC curve and computed AUC to analyze binary classification performance.

# 3)Performance Evaluation

Practiced computing metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F1-score from confusion matrices.

Discussed the impact of imbalanced datasets and when metrics beyond accuracy (like precision/recall/F1) are more informative.

Applied cross-validation to estimate model generalization error and choose optimal hyperparameters (e.g., best k in kNN).
